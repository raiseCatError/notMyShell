# Changelog

All notable changes to NMSh are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- **Structured Execution Presentation**: Dynamically classifies PTY output into `INLINE`, `FOLDED`, `LIVE`, or `PASSTHROUGH` modes based on output characteristics.
- **Factual Command Milestones**: Real-time status now states factual observations (e.g., `Running npm test`) and explicitly reports exit codes.
- **Deterministic Summaries**: Output adapters parse standard CLI tools (`npm`, `jest`, `mocha`, Node TAP, `brew cleanup`, `git commit`) to display rich, structured summary facts.
- **Output Folding**: Clickable and keyboard-navigable (`Ctrl+O`) toggles for collapsing or expanding noisy terminal output blocks in history.
- **Native Selection Preservation**: Shift+Drag natively selects terminal text while NMSh handles editor focus.

### Fixed
- Multiline shell commands no longer break the live-status renderer and clear correctly from the frame upon completion.
- Node.js TAP test summaries are accurately parsed matching the actual `ℹ` info glyphs emitted by the PTY.
- `SemanticService` is robust against host-specific terminal scripts (e.g. `Apple_Terminal` in macOS `.zshrc`) by isolating its environment with `TERM=dumb`.
- `SemanticService` gracefully prevents deadlocks by safely settling pending classification promises if the helper crashes or exits.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- Persistent real zsh PTY frontend.
- Multiline editor locked to the bottom of the terminal.
- Semantic syntax highlighting via asynchronous helper processes.
- Semantic highlighting is preserved persistently in the history viewport.
- Autocomplete and completion bridge.
- History ghost suggestions.
- Lifecycle and animated activity UI for running commands.
- Fullscreen and interactive application passthrough handling.
- Integrated `/copy`, `/history`, `/appearance`, and `/keyboard` commands.
- Visual README demo generation pipeline.
- Controlled zsh bootstrap preventing aggressive startup tasks.
- Machine-readable discoverability configuration (`AGENTS.md`, `llms.txt`).

### Fixed
- Process cleanup teardown to safely kill detached helper shells and delete temporary configuration directories during testing.
